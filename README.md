Make sure to be using nvm to install iojs or a version of node as new as the latest iojs

Once uploaded to a server if you run ``./install.sh`` everything should be good to go just copy the ``sample_config.js`` to ``./config/config.js`` and change the config to match the way you'd like Xtend to run or set the environment variables as they're listed in the file.
